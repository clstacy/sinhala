# Learn the Sinhala Alphabet

Welcome to my **Sinhala Alphabet Matching Game** â€“ a fun side project I built to help myself and others learn the Sinhala alphabet.

## Features

- **Randomized Learning:** Letters are introduced in randomized groups, ensuring a varied learning experience.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Letters guessed correctly more often are shown less frequently.
- **Progress Saving:** Your progress (correct guesses, learned letters, and settings) is saved locally in your browser.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust learning parameters such as initial group size, threshold for learned letters, number of new letters introduced, and round size.
- **Subset by Type:** Switch between practicing vowels, consonants, or the entire alphabet.

## Getting Started

The game is available for free at: [clstacy.github.io/sinhala](https://clstacy.github.io/sinhala)

### How to Play

1. Choose to practice vowels, consonants, or all letters.
2. Match the Sinhala letters on the right with their English transliterations on the left.
3. Track your stats and adjust settings for a personalized learning experience.

### Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
- JavaScript enabled.

### Adjusting Game Settings
Use the controls at the top of the page to:
- Change the initial number of letters shown.
- Set the threshold for when a letter is considered "learned."
- Define how many new letters are added during each phase.
- Adjust the round size for how many pairs are shown at a time.

### Saving Progress
Your progress is saved automatically using `localStorage`. When you return to the game on the same browser and device, your progress will be restored.
