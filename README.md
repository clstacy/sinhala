# Learn the Sinhala Alphabet

Hi there! Welcome to the game I made to learn the Sinhala alphabet. This is weekend side project I built as a fun and interactive way to help myself (and maybe you!) learn the Sinhala alphabet. It‚Äôs a simple game that aims to make the process enjoyable. Perfect for language learners or anyone curious about the Sinhala script!

## Getting Started

The game is free and easy to play. No downloads or installations required! Just visit:

üëâ [clstacy.github.io/sinhala](https://clstacy.github.io/sinhala) üëà

## How to Play

- Select what you‚Äôd like to practice: vowels, consonants, or everything.
- Match the Sinhala letters on the right with their English transliterations on the left.
- Use the stats at the top of the page to track your progress and see how well you‚Äôre doing.
- Adjust game settings (if you want) or consult the Letter Guide if you need a refresher.

## What You‚Äôll Need:

- A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
- JavaScript enabled.

That‚Äôs it! Just click and start learning.

## Features

- Randomized Learning: Letters are introduced in manageable, randomized groups, so you‚Äôre not overwhelmed.
- Adaptive Learning: The more often you guess a letter correctly, the less frequently it appears.
- Progress Tracking: Your progress is saved automatically (locally, in your browser), so you can pick up where you left off.
- Customizable Settings: Want to tweak how the game works? Adjust the learning parameters to fit your style.
- Practice Options: Choose to focus on vowels, consonants, or the entire alphabet.
- Letter Reference: Need a little help? Open the ‚ÄúLetter Guide‚Äù anytime to see all the letters and their English transliterations.



## Game Settings

For those who like to fine-tune their learning experience:

- `Initial Group Size`: Control how many letters you start with.
- `Learned Threshold`: Define how many correct guesses it takes for a letter to be considered mastered.
- `New Letters`: Choose how many new letters are added at each phase.
- `Round Size`: Set how many letter pairs appear in each round.

Settings are tucked away under the little hamburger menu in the bottom-right corner. I was overwhelmed seeing so many at once, so this allows me can adjust accordingly

## Saving Progress

Progress is automatically saved to your browser (via localStorage), so you can come back later and pick up right where you left off. It‚Äôs all local, no accounts or logins needed. This is my first time using this, so I hope it works!
